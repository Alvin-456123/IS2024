# Tour of A PC. Tour

### 1. CPU?
The CPU is often referred to as the brain of the computer. It performs calculations, executes instructions, and manages tasks. Modern CPUs come with multiple cores, which allow them to process multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing performance for multitasking and demanding applications.

### 2. Motherboard?
The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of a computer. It houses the CPU, RAM, and other essential parts, providing pathways for communication between them. It also includes ports for peripherals and connectors for power.

### 3. RAM (Random Access Memory)
RAM is a type of volatile memory used to store data that the CPU needs while performing tasks. The more RAM a system has, the more data it can process quickly, which is especially beneficial for running multiple applications or high-performance software.

### 4. SSD (Solid State Drivers)
An SSD is a storage device that uses flash memory to store data, offering faster read and write speeds compared to traditional hard drives (HDDs). This leads to quicker boot times, faster application loading, and improved overall system performance.

### 5. Removable Media (e.g., USB Drive)
Removable media refers to portable storage devices that can be easily connected and disconnected from a computer. USB drives, external hard drives, and SD cards are common examples. They are useful for transferring data between devices or for backup purposes.

### 6. Network Connection
Network connections allow a computer to communicate with other devices over the internet or local networks. This can be achieved through wired connections (like Ethernet) or wireless connections (like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), enabling data sharing, remote access, and internet browsing.

### 7. IO (Input and Otput): e.g., Bluetooth, keyboard, display
I/O refers to the interfaces that allow communication between the computer and external devices. Input devices (like keyboards and mice) let users interact with the computer, while output devices (like monitors and printers) display or produce information. Bluetooth is an example of a wireless I/O technology that enables communication with peripherals.
